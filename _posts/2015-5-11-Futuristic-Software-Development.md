title: Futuristic Software Development
---
You're at your desk.  
You've been writing code for hours now.  
You're trying to get your assigned project rolled out in spite of all the interruptions,
the lack of caffeine in your body, the background noise of people arguing whether it's Customer Support or just two developers debating about what to name a variable.  

Did you ever wonder why the number of software engineers increased as companies grew?

When will we stop reinventing the wheel?
Don't get me started on the frequency of JS frameworks that keeps increasing every year.
